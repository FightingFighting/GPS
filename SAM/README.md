Update on 28 April: We tested the performance of polyp segmentation to show our approach can also work on medical datasets.

Update on 22 April: We report our SOTA result based on ViT-H version of SAM (use demo.yaml). We have also uploaded the yaml config for ViT-L and ViT-B version of SAM, suitable  GPU with smaller memory (e.g. NVIDIA Tesla V-100), although they may compromise on accuracy.

## Environment
This code was implemented with Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.13.0. You can install all the requirements via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Quick Start
1. Download the dataset and put it in ./load.
2. Download the pre-trained [SAM(Segment Anything)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and put it in ./pretrained.
3. Training:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 4 loadddptrain.py --config configs/demo.yaml
```
!Please note that the SAM model consume much memory. We use 4 x A100 graphics card for training. If you encounter the memory issue, please try to use graphics cards with larger memory!


4. Evaluation:
```bash
python test.py --config [CONFIG_PATH] --model [MODEL_PATH]
```

## Train
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -m torch.distributed.launch train.py --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 4 --config [CONFIG_PATH]
```

## Test
```bash
python test.py --config [CONFIG_PATH] --model [MODEL_PATH]
```
